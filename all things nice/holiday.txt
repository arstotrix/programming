Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame the ones who died without a name

Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called Faith and Misery (Hey!)
And plead, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protestor has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find, the money's on the other side

Can I get another Amen (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around the score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

"The representative from California has the floor"

Zeig Heil to the president gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass man
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Triumph by fires, setting fire
It's not a way that's meant for me
Just cause
Just cuz we're on holiday

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
