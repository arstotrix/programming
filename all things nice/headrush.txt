Check it out
I'm a nightmare
I'm a double dare
I'm the last one to care but I don't care
Skating down the driveway

Ya like it? [x2]

I'm a crosshair
With a cold stare
Got a monkey on my back heading nowhere
Lighting up the galaxy

Ya like it? [x2]

[Chorus:]
Like a headrush
That you've never felt before
Like a royal flush
So good that you cannot ignore
You can't get enough
Cuz I'm rotten to the core
No need to fight the battle
I've already won the war
Like a headrush

I'm a time bomb
Try to stay calm
Exploding on site then I get none
Radioactive when I bleed

Ya like it? [x2]

Pumping napalm
Got a firearm
Ring out to the sky like an alarm
I'm shooting on the count of 3

Ya like it? [x2]

Caught up in my trip wire
Arson fire, pyro glow
I'm gonna light it up and show you
Shit that you could never know
Amplifying higher my desire is
To fall free
All I ever wanted
Wait till they get a load of me

[Chorus:]
Like a headrush
That you've never felt before
Like a royal flush
So good that you cannot ignore
You can't get enough
Cuz I'm rotten to the core
No need to fight the battle
I've already won the war
Like a headrush

All killer
No filler
Psycho thriller
Drink it all but I drank too much
I think I sprained my liver
Cutting down bullshit faeces pieces
Into smaller slivers
Better make some room cuz I'm a
Mutha fuckin' heavy hitter

[Chorus: 2x]
Like a headrush
That you've never felt before
Like a royal flush
So good that you cannot ignore
You can't get enough
Cuz I'm rotten to the core
No need to fight the battle
I've already won the war
Like a headrush

That you've never felt before

Ya like it? [x2]

You feel it
Like a headrush
So good that you cannot ignore

Ya like it? [x2]

Cuz I'm rotten to the core
