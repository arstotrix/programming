Summer has gone too fast,
The innocence can never last,
Wake me up, when September ends

Like my father's come to pass,
Seven years have gone so fast,
Wake me up, when September ends

Here comes the rain again,
Falling from the stars,
Drenched in my pain again,
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests,
But never forgets what I lost,
Wake me up, when September ends
 
Summer has gone too fast,
The innocence can never last,
Wake me up, when September ends

Like my father's come to pass,
Twenty years have gone so fast,
Wake me up, when September ends

Here comes the rain again,
Falling from the stars,
Drenched in my pain again,
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests,
But never forgets what I lost,
Wake me up, when September ends
Wake me up, when September ends  
Wake me up, when September ends
